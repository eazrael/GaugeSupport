## Note

This was just a small quick & dirty hack to make this plugin work with PostgreSQL. Code was dirty enough, so I think I did not made it worse. No other cleanups/improvements. Added German translation. I do not know much about the history. Guessed GPL from lang/strings_english.txt and authorship from the same file. I do not claim authorship of anything, just want to get this working again.
